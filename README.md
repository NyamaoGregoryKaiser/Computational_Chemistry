# **Biomass Modeling in Forest Ecology**

This repository contains Python code that models the transfer of biomass between living trees, dead trees, and humus in a forest ecosystem over time. The model is based on a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and uses Python libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib for computation and visualization.

## **Project Overview**

In this project, we study how biomass moves between living trees, dead trees, and humus, the organic component of soil formed by decomposing plant material. The model is governed by the following ODEs:

\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = -x + 3y
\]
\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = -3y + 5z
\]
\[
\frac{dz}{dt} = -5z
\]

Where:
- \( x \) is the biomass in humus,
- \( y \) is the biomass in dead trees,
- \( z \) is the biomass in living trees.

The model simulates how the biomass moves between these components over decades.

## **Files**

- **`biomass_derivatives.py`**: Python script defining the function `biomass_derivatives()` that calculates the rates of change in biomass for living trees, dead trees, and humus over time.
- **`biomass_modeling.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation of the biomass modeling system. This notebook also includes tests and visualizations.

## **Usage**

### **Running the Code**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/biomass_modeling.git
   cd biomass_modeling
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
   You need to install `numpy` and `matplotlib` to run the code. Install them using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open the notebook file `biomass_modeling.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab, and execute the cells to see the biomass model in action.

4. **Run the Python script**:
   You can also use the `biomass_derivatives.py` script in a Python environment. To compute the derivatives at any time point, use the function `biomass_derivatives()`.

### **Example Usage**:

To compute the derivatives of the biomass system at \( t = 0 \) with initial values of \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 \), and \( z = 809601 \):

```python
from biomass_derivatives import biomass_derivatives

# Initial values of x, y, z
x0 = 0
y0 = 0
z0 = 809601
t = 0

# Calculate the derivatives
derivatives = biomass_derivatives(t, [x0, y0, z0])
print(derivatives)  # Expected output: [0, 4048005, -4048005]
```

## **Model Parameters**

- **x(0)**: Initial biomass in humus, in thousands of tons.
- **y(0)**: Initial biomass in dead trees, in thousands of tons.
- **z(0)**: Initial biomass in living trees, in thousands of tons (809,601 tons based on 2012 Michigan forest data).

## **Visualization**

The notebook includes a plot that visualizes how the biomass shifts over time. The plot shows the relationship between the living trees, dead trees, and humus biomass, as well as the derivatives calculated by the model.
